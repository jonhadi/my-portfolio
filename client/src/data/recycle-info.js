However, if the box is mostly clean with just a few specks of grease, you’re fine to recycle it. The same goes for other contaminants. If you’re making pancakes and a drop of egg lands on the box, it’s still clean enough to recycle. However, too much of a mess will make it impossible to recycle. Additionally, crumpled, torn or misshapen paper and cardboard can be recycled the same as flat products.",

You don’t need to scrub the remains in the mayonnaise jar with soap before recycling, and a few spots won’t likely hinder the process. For most items, just fill the container with water and vigorously swish the water around inside. (Or better yet, use leftover dishwashing water just before you drain it.) If the residue is sticky like jelly or honey, you may need to use a scrub brush or scraper to remove more of the product.",

If there is sticky film or residue, such as peanut butter or mustard left over in a sandwich bag, it must be washed out. After washing any plastic bags, make sure that the bags are dried completely before recycling, as excess water can interfere with the melting process during recycling.",
